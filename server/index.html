<p><b>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)</b></p>

<p>
Communicating Sequential Processes, or CSP, is a language for
describing patterns of interaction.  It is supported by an elegant,
mathematical theory, a set of proof tools, and an extensive
literature.  The book <em>Communicating Sequential Processes</em> was
first published in 1985 by Prentice Hall International (who have
kindly released the copyright); it is an excellent introduction to the
language, and also to the mathematical theory.</p>
